# Gaussian-Mixture-Models
This project implements Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) on the MNIST dataset and later compares this model to k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) classification. Additionally, the project includes unittests to verify functionality and performance.

## Requirements

- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn ("https://scikit-learn.org/1.5/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.fetch_openml.html")
- scipy
- minst_784

## General objectives
- Implement Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) on MNIST
- Implement k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) for Comparison
- Model Evaluation and Comparison
- Automated Testing (Unittests)
